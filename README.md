-   Open a Pull Request to the base repository

## What needs to be done

-   Be a hacker: find a way to successfully login to the app - hint: no code change needed.

    -   Email dans l'api du .env
    -   Mot de passe pr√©sent dans auth.api.ts

-   Be a saviour: fix a bug in the app. Each time we refresh the page, we're back to the login screen. Fix it so we stay on the current page.
-   Be a builder: add new a page to the app and fetch all photos (/photos) with the same API as the one used for the login.
